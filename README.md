# 🎵 Music Genre Classification & Clustering Project

Welcome to my data science showcase project,this project was inspired by a music classification challenge I tackled during my data science learning journey . This repository demonstrates my journey through predictive analytics, machine learning, and unsupervised learning — all wrapped in a real-world music dataset.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project explores the classification of music genres using machine learning techniques and clustering analysis on a separate dataset. It reflects my ability to:
- Understand and audit real-world data
- Engineer features and preprocess datasets
- Build and evaluate predictive models (SVM, Decision Trees, etc.)
- Apply unsupervised learning (K-Means clustering)
- Communicate insights clearly through code, visuals, and documentation

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Given a dataset of songs with various audio features (e.g., danceability, tempo, loundness), the goal is to predict the music genre of each track. Additionally, I explore clustering techniques on a separate dataset to uncover hidden patterns and groupings.


## 🧪 Methodologies Used

- **Supervised Learning**: Multi-class classification using Support Vector Machines and alternative classifiers
- **Data Preprocessing**: Feature scaling, handling missing values, and class imbalance
- **Model Evaluation**: Confusion matrices, accuracy comparison, and error analysis
- **Unsupervised Learning**: K-Means clustering on a custom dataset with justification for cluster count
- **Visualization**: Pie charts, bar plots, and cluster scatter plots to communicate findings

## 📊 Key Achievements

- Built a robust classification pipeline with reproducible results
- Compared model performance and explained misclassifications
- Independently explored SVMs and kernel functions beyond the classroom
- Participated in a Kaggle-style evaluation to simulate real-world deployment
- Selected and analyzed an external dataset for clustering, demonstrating initiative and autonomy

## 🛠 Technologies

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git & GitHub
- Kaggle (for evaluation simulation)

## 💡 What You'll Find Here

This repository is not just a submission — it's a reflection of how I think, learn, and grow as a data scientist. I’ve documented my methodology, decisions, and challenges in [`docs/METHODOLOGY.md`](docs/METHODOLOGY.md), so you can follow my journey beyond the code.

## 📌 Future Improvements
- Hyperparameter tuning for better model performance
- Experimenting with ensemble methods like XGBoost
- Deploying the model via a simple web app (e.g., Streamlit)
- Expanding clustering analysis with PCA or t-SNE for dimensionality reduction
