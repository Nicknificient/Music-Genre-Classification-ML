Welcome to my data science showcase project! This repository demonstrates a complete journey through predictive analytics and unsupervised learning, inspired by a real-world music classification challenge. It's a reflection of how I approach problems, learn new techniques, and communicate findings as a data scientist.

## 🎯 Project Goals

The primary goal is to predict the music genre of a song given a set of audio features. The project tackles this through two main machine learning approaches:

1.  **Supervised Learning:** To build a robust classification pipeline that accurately predicts a song's genre.
2.  **Unsupervised Learning:** To explore a separate dataset using clustering to uncover natural groupings and hidden patterns within the music tracks.

## 💿 Datasets Used

This project utilizes two distinct datasets:
1.  **Classification Dataset:** The [Name of Your Dataset, e.g., GTZAN Genre Collection] was used for the genre prediction task. It contains audio features for thousands of tracks across multiple genres.
2.  **Clustering Dataset:** A custom dataset of songs with features like `danceability`, `tempo`, and `loudness` was used to explore unsupervised learning techniques.

## 🧪 Methodology

The project workflow is documented across several Jupyter notebooks, covering everything from initial data checks to final model evaluation.

### 1. Data Audit & Preprocessing
- **Objective:** To ensure the data is clean, balanced, and ready for modeling.
- **Process:**
  - Checked for missing values and duplicates.
  - Analyzed class distribution to identify any genre imbalances.
  - Applied feature scaling (e.g., `StandardScaler`) to normalize the data, which is crucial for distance-based algorithms like SVM and K-Means.

### 2. Supervised Learning: Classification
- **Objective:** To build and evaluate models for genre prediction.
- **Models Implemented:** Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
- **Process:**
  - Split the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
  - Trained multiple classifiers to compare their performance.
  - Independently explored different SVM kernels to understand their impact beyond standard classroom examples.
  - Performed a Kaggle-style evaluation to simulate a real-world deployment scenario.

### 3. Unsupervised Learning: Clustering
- **Objective:** To identify inherent structures in the music data without using predefined labels.
- **Algorithm Used:** K-Means Clustering.
- **Process:**
  - Analyzed a separate, custom dataset to demonstrate initiative.
  - Used the "Elbow Method" to determine the optimal number of clusters (`k`).
  - Visualized the resulting clusters to interpret their characteristics (e.g., "high-energy dance tracks" vs. "slow, acoustic tracks").

## 🏆 Results & Key Achievements

- **Built a robust classification pipeline** with an accuracy of [e.g., 82%] on the test set, with the Random Forest model performing the best.
- **Compared multiple models** and analyzed their confusion matrices to understand specific misclassifications and strengths.
- **Successfully applied K-Means clustering** to an external dataset, identifying [e.g., 4] distinct music groups and interpreting their properties.
- **Documented the entire process**, showcasing strong communication skills alongside technical ability.

## 🧠 Challenges & Learnings

- **Model Selection:** Choosing the right model was a key challenge. While SVMs are powerful, the Random Forest proved more effective for this dataset, highlighting the importance of empirical testing.
- **Feature Interpretation:** Understanding what features like `MFCCs` or `spectral_contrast` represent musically was a learning curve but crucial for interpreting results.
- **Justifying Cluster Count:** In unsupervised learning, justifying the choice of `k` is subjective. Using the Elbow Method provided a data-driven justification for the final cluster count.

## 💡 Future Improvements

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Implement `GridSearchCV` or `RandomizedSearchCV` to fine-tune the models for even better performance.
- **Ensemble Methods:** Experiment with advanced models like Gradient Boosting or XGBoost.
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Use PCA or t-SNE to visualize the clusters in 2D and potentially improve clustering performance.
- **Deployment:** Deploy the final classification model as a simple web app using Streamlit or Flask.
