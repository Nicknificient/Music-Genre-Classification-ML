Hi Sir/Madam,

Thanks for taking the time to review my work. Iâ€™ve uploaded one of my recent Jupyter Notebook projects to Google Drive, where you can view the code and all executed outputs (graphs, tables, results).

ðŸ”— View the notebook here: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/13VfYjWTJRHvjf0Bi5Df1V3vSYi1FzZao/view?usp=sharing]

If you'd like to run the notebook interactively or see more of my work, feel free to reach out to me at [totowong0810@gmail.com]. I'm happy to share additional projects or walk you through the code.

Best regards,  
Nicholas
