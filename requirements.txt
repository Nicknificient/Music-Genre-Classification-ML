Knowledge (helpful but not required to skim results):
- Basic Python and Jupyter Notebook usage
- Basic ML concepts: train/test split, cross‑validation, accuracy/F1/ROC‑AUC

Environment (to run locally):
- Python 3.10+ (or the version in environment.yml)
- Jupyter or JupyterLab
- Packages in requirements.txt (install with `pip install -r requirements.txt`)
- Dataset access: place the class dataset in data/raw/ (not included in the repo)
- Hardware: standard laptop is fine (~2–4GB RAM for this workflow)

View‑only (no setup):
- You can read the README and open the notebook on GitHub or nbviewer without installing anything.
